          <p>
            The screeching, hissing handshake of a dial-up modem wasn't just noise; it was the sound of possibility. That BBS I ran as a kid? It wasn't just a hobby. It was my first ritual engine. A proto-temple of text files, ANSI art, and raw possibility. I didn't know the word "ontology" yet, but I was already trying to build one. In Turbo Pascal. With vibes.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I was feeding glyphs into the void, convinced that if I typed the right thing at the right prompt, the universe might answer back. This wasn't about creating a bulletin board—it was about building a lens to see the world through systems, loops, and patterns. The Epoch BBS message menu became my first digital canvas for organizing information, where my techno bard voice first emerged.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Even then, I wasn't chasing answers; I was chasing patterns. The BBS was my first shack, a proto-space where chaos found a home. That kid feeding glyphs into the void is still here. The stack just got deeper. The rituals more precise. The modem screech still carries signal.

            I never stopped trying to solve that problem: How do you take chaos—notes, logs, midnight revelations—and not just store it, but make it usable? I built platforms to do that for others: internal learning systems, developer workflows, scalable knowledge tools.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            And then I burned out. The kind of burnout where you wonder if your brain will ever come back online.

          <p>
            FLOAT was born from that wreckage. Not a product. A ritual. A survivable system for containing complexity without requiring purity. I wasn't organizing to remember. I was organizing to regenerate. To see the pattern in the noise. To let emergence speak.
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl mt-6 mb-3">Teaching as Pattern Play</h3>
          
          <p>
            At Ceridian, I delivered intensive JavaScript/TypeScript/React training for developers who primarily worked in C#. This wasn't just about syntax—it was translation between mental models. I had to ask: How could I introduce concepts in a way they would understand? What OOP patterns were they used to, and how could I show them accomplishing similar things with different approaches?
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I wasn't teaching React; I was teaching how to see the matrix—patterns that stick, no matter the stack. The results spoke for themselves, with even skeptics saying: "I thought I knew 70% of this—but you filled gaps I didn't even know I had."
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When I teach, I'm not just teaching how to build a todo app. I'm teaching how to recognize and apply patterns—even in places you've never been before. Instead of just delivering recipes, I work to:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Map new ideas onto things you already know</li>
            <li>Break concepts down into modular patterns</li>
            <li>Show how those patterns recombine across frameworks and architectures</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Teaching isn't a side skill. It's ritual engineering—building scaffolds for exploration, not temples of doctrine.

          <h3 className="text-xl mt-6 mb-3">FLOAT and Systems Everywhere</h3>
          
          <p>
            FLOAT, and tools like floatctl, aren't just software. They are ritual infrastructures for recursive cognition—a symbiotic dance between thought, tooling, and glitch. Think FLOAT's flow—Prompt$ → Middleware → Memory$—but for content creation. AI's the middleware, and we're the memory, keeping it real.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            At their core, they embody:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Small pieces, loosely joined: Inspired by the Unix philosophy, adapted for cognitive workflows</li>
            <li>Low cognitive drag: Capture and organize thought without breaking the flow</li>
            <li>Conceptual scaffolds like FloatAST and RitualAST—not just databases, but maps of meaning</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            One of the core threads running through everything I build is this: Systems are everywhere. It's systems all the way down. Personal knowledge lives within broader systems of meaning and memory. Systems live inside ecosystems with boundaries, interfaces, and unexpected feedback loops. Everything becomes composable once you understand the patterns.

            This isn't about becoming someone new. It's about remembering forward. Integrating every version of myself—the burnt-out engineer, the hyperfocused builder, the glitchy techno bard who still believes the right prompt can open a portal.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Our conversation about this article is the perfect example—we nudged it into existence through prompt loops and state tracking, using the "LLMs as fuzzy compilers" metaphor. Redux in spirit, rituals as dispatches. The AI pushed too far toward perfection at points, becoming "LinkedIn slop"—all structure, no soul. We pulled back, letting the seams show, finding the humanity again.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This cycle of "getting there, getting there, almost there" and then overcorrection is where we learn to trust the system—when reality breaks and we can see which side of the fracture we're on. The "little fucker" (the queer techno bard's pup) needs a minute to do his work, but he always comes through.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I believe in accepting imperfections—finding ways to make them part of the whole, not throw them away. This concept evolved from angry scribbles to calming straight lines in journals, overcoming perfectionism's paralysis. Shacks last because they flex.
